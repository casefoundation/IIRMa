# Network Map

## About

In 2017, the we launched the Impacting Investing Network Map to showcase “who is active and what have they done?” in the realm of impact investing. The Network Map demonstrates the publicly available transactions between investors and companies within impact investing. We believe that by bringing the connections between actors to life – looking specifically at the investments that connect them – we can foster a better understanding of the size, breadth, depth and, importantly, the enormous potential of this field.

We're excited to be bringing the power of the Network Map to everyone by open sourcing the code powering it. Now, other impact investing communities - or anyone wishing to visualize transnational relationships like investing - may use our open source code base to build their visualization.
