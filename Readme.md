# Relationship Visualization Map

## About

The Case Foundation developed the Impact Investing Network Map, with data partners Impact Space and CrunchBase, to present the best publicly available data on impact investments to better inform the sector. We believe that bringing the connections between investors and companies to life will foster a better understanding of the size, breadth and depth of the impact investing ecosystem and incorporated engaging data visualizations to try to bring the data from this quickly growing sector to life. 

Now we are excited to announce that we are open sourcing the code from this project so you can repurpose and reimagine this data visualization product for your own new projects. The code powering the relationship map visualization, filtering options and insights section will be open and free to use on the Case Foundationâ€™s GitHub account, as the Investment Visualization Toolkit. While the basis of our original Impact Investing Network Map was to display historical direct investments made into companies by investors using publicly available data, with the open source you can use the code to create your own projects and bring your own data to life. You can use it to bring your own Impact Investing data to life, expand the options and features available or apply it to data outside the Impact Investing sector.
