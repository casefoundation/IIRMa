# Investment Visualization Toolkit

## About

The Case Foundation developed the Impact Investing Network Map, with
data partners Impact Space and CrunchBase, to present the best publicly
available data on impact investments to better inform the sector. We
believe that bringing the connections between investors and companies to
life will foster a better understanding of the size, breadth and depth
of the impact investing ecosystem. Since launching the Impact Investing
Network Map, we have gathered feedback from many users and have
repeatedly heard interest in applying the visualization and lessons
learned to other projects and sources of data.

We are excited to announce that we are open sourcing the code of the
Impact Investing Network Map, for others to repurpose and reimagine our
product for their own new projects. The code powering the relationship
map visualization, filtering options and insights section will be open
and free to use on the Case Foundation's GitHub account, as the
\*Relationship Map Visualization. While the basis of our original Impact
Investing Network Map was to display historical direct investments made
into companies by investors using publicly available data, with the open
source Investment Visualization Toolkit, users can

-   apply their own dataset for projects like visualizing local impact
    investment activity;
-   update the code with new functions, filters, and visualization
    features; or
-   even apply the code for a purpose outside of Impact Investing.

We are appreciative of the resources and expertise provided by our
advisors. We utilized elements of the [CASE Smart Impact Capital, Impact
Capital 101: Supply and Demand
diagram](https://casesmartimpact.com/capital/check-out-smart-impact-capital/) to
help illustrate the flow of capital between the supply and demand side
actors. Check out the
full [video](https://casesmartimpact.com/capital/check-out-smart-impact-capital/) to
learn more on capital flows within Impact Investing.
